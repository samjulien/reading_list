== README

This is just a simple reading list app that follows along with Codeschool's[www.codeschool.com] Soup to Bits screencast for their second Rails course, except I did a couple of extra things:

* Used Foundation instead of Bootstrap
* Implemented edit action
* Implemented remote destroy

In the future, I'd like to implement CRUD functions for the genres.

To run, just use the standard <tt>bundle install</tt> and <tt>rake db:setup</tt>.
